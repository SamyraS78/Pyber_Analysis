# Pyber_Analysis
Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
Results:
The new analysis aims to understand the total volume for the number of rides and fares for each city type. To do this, the project was developed to calculate the total number of drivers per city, average fares per city, and average fares per driver in the different cities. 

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
Summary:
based on the analysis conducted, rideshares in rural areas do not perform as well as in suburban and urban areas. we can attribute this difference to the larger populations found in these types of cities as well.
  
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
Once the data frame for the dates per city type was created a new pattern emerged for rural ridership.
The rural rates tend to be higher during the first of the month and slow down toward the middle of the month. while Suburban and Urban rates increase more steadily over time. there is some minor fluctuation toward the middle of march but not too significant where the ridership isn't profitable.
Recommendations:
1. It is recommended that new marketing be created to increase ridership in rural areas. 
2. To stabilize Suburban ridership would be to focus on promoting ways ride-sharing can reduce congestion.
3. To maintain urban ridership, it is recommended that specials and deals are given during monthly downturns.
